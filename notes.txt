What I want to test for the jackknife error, in order to determine how well it estimates the actual error of the sample mean, is

1. a) That the ensemble average (average over N as N->infinity) of the jackknife error is equal to the actual error of the sample mean.

b) If not, then it is biased, but it should at least equal the actual error in the limit n->inifinity as well.

2. If it fails 1a then look at the error on the jackknife error and see if the actual error of the sample mean is within this error of the jackknife error.

3. Check that the error on the jackknife error is "small" (for e.g. less than 50%), because otherwise it is pretty useless even if the ensemble average is correct.
